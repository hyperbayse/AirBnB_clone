## The console

## Description
This project is aimed at implementing the Full-Stack Application Development and puting into practice what we have been learning so far throughout this program in ALX Software Engineering. The console is a python command interpreter that is gives the developer an admin-privilege to manipulate and update the main application from the command line without using the graphical interface mode.

## Command Interpreter

__How to start it__
To start the console file, you simply have to be on your terminal and run the consle.py file as executable
```python
./console.py
```

__How to use it__
In order to use the console, type in help to see all the avialable command. Then you just have to input the needed command and that is it.

__Examples__
Here is the simple example of starting the project and the output
```python
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
